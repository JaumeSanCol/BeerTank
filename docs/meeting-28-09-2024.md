# SCI Meeting 28/09/2024

## Users
 - Staff: can see stats:
    - amount of beer
    - temperature
    - pressure
    - flow (maybe)
    - can assign tokens

 - Common user:
    - can pour beer through the app
    - can spend token to pour beer (maybe nfc, button, app)

## Application
 - 2 users
 - Staff can assign tokens
 - Common user can spend token
 - Chose which machine serves (or NFC connect)

## Hardware (* - not included in the kit)
 - Flux sensor (for pouring beer)
 - Servo motor / valve *
 - Temperature sensor
 - Pressure sensor
 - Communication harware for connecting to the server
 - Pump (maybe, unless gravity fed) *
 - Magnetic sensor on the machine and a metal tag on the cup (to prevent pouring without a cup)
 - Water sensor *
 - NFC tags *
 - Arduino
 - Raspberry Pi
 - Beer barrel and dispenser (or potentially a water jug repurposed for it)

## Plan
 - 3 Teams (dont need to be rigid):
    - App team
    - Hardware team
    - Communication team

## Questions for the teacher
 - Unsure wether to use the Raspberry Pi for hosting (cloud), or to handle intermediate communication (fog) or both, or if the arduino can be considered part of the fog layer

# SCI Meeting 25/10/2024

## clarifications

 - Token to cup or through phone
    - through cup
 - fake payment to generate a token from the client
 - buy a beer for some one else - generate one token for them
 - one token for one beer
 - the app loads one token (just the ID) to the nfc of the cup
 - when you put a cup on the machine, it sends a request to the server to validate the token. The server then sends a notification to the user's phone to confirm the use of that token. Only when the user agrees, is the token spent and the beer poured. To avoid stealing tokens
 - rapberry - +-load balancer:
    - sends statistical data from the arduinos to the cloud every so often, example:
        - temperature when it changes
        - beer level when it changes
        - or every 5 minutes or something

## cloud and app routing
 - cloud uses authentication and session tokens:
    - one for access
    - one for refreshing the access token
 - app needs to send:
    - access token
    - if it is rejected, it needs to send the refresh to a different route
    - if success, have a new token, if failure, needs to re login
